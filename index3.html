                            This is more than a hobby to Fonte, its what has defined and shaped his character to the person he is today.
                        </p>
                        <li><h5>Gaming</h5></li>

                            <img src="Gaming.webp" width="175" height="165"> <br>
                            This is the best way for Fonte to unwind after a long day of workouts and coding projects.

                        <p>Sometimes Fonte gets so weighed down by a lot of things that kinda demotivates him to carry on with his daily <br>
                            activities and it's times like those that he must really gather himself up and style up his life and ensure <br>
                            he resumes with his daily routine as soon as possible: These are the top 3 statements he always utters to himself <br>
                            to get back on his feet and get on with the journey.
